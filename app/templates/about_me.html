  I recently received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. I'm currently employed as a python/web
  developer. I love creating things that make people's lives easier. I agree with this statement. Until this date, the
  products I've created had a purpose and had an impact in the real world. Apart from that, I travel a lot to keep my
  inner engineering stable.
