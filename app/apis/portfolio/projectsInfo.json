In space as well as in vacuum metallic parts especially which are those subjected to friction especially gears and bearings wear out very fast. The Whole project was built from scratch level giving my team immense learning and working experience <br/> <br/> For me, this project is a roller coaster from exploring different technologies such as Ros, Arduino. Raspberry pie., and to experiencing electric shock and smoke effect where the whole dedication was put to finish this project see my project gallery for my project journey",

    "short_info": "Identifing Industrial TMT Rods",
    "long_info": "TMT(Thermo Mechanical treatment) rods are the walloping production of the steel industries and they require tailor-made measurements for each construction site. for that there are huge machines that will make the task of cutting TMT rods easier for industries. while cutting the rods they measure for efficient cutting for that they use a photoelectric sensor, Manual labor, and complex computing machine that ended up in huge maintenance of the machines and time-consuming process, in the last decade research on Digital image processing and computer vision has seen much progress. <br/> <br/> I build a methodology that is adaptable for the industries in measuring the TMT rods much more efficiently maximizing the efficiency, robust towards cram-full of rods, and minimizing the error rate. The captured digital image first undergoes the preprocessing phase where the first step is image enhancement and then edge detection, which extracts the TMT rods edges then followed by the diameter calculations (pixels per metric). An experiment was conducted on a variety of challenging conditions to demonstrate the capability of our approach to a good measure of success  <br/> <br/> This project gave me hope of applying AI(Computer Vision) to construction equipment and materials. The challenges are even bigger when it went to the production level as construction are filled with sawdust everywhere this made large noise in the image and also made our task even  harder in preprocessing stage, the other challenge was a bright light that we require while capturing image A right contrast of light is required while capturing the image that will help us in identifying the edges of the rod this was later rectified through a  contrast library mdoule",
